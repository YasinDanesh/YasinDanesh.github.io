Welcome to my academic website! Im currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at [Isfahan University of Technology](https://www.iut.ac.ir). My focus lies in **artificial intelligence (AI)**, **computer vision**, and **machine learning**, where I aim to merge theoretical knowledge with practical applications.

## Academic Interests and Research

I am deeply interested in:

- AI and Machine Learning
- Neural Networks (CNN, RNN)
- Computer Vision and Image Processing
- Network Architecture, Optimization, and Security

I have worked on various projects ranging from **handwriting recognition** to **medical detections using CNNs**. Additionally, Iâ€™ve researched **data compression methods using AI** and am currently writing a paper on using **Tree-Structured MLP** for medical image compression.

## Technical Experiences

I have gained professional experience during my **internship at Payampardaz**, where I focused on **researching and implementing AI in SD-WAN**. I developed machine learning models for fault management, utilizing real-world datasets to predict network faults and improve reliability. This hands-on experience helped me hone my skills in AI model development and network solutions.

Additionally, I participated in the **Neural Network Summer Camp** at Isfahan University of Technology, where I worked extensively with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. During this camp, I developed projects involving DNN, CNN, and RNN architectures, solidifying my understanding of **deep learning** and its applications to real-world problems.

## Teaching Experiences

I have also been actively involved in **teaching and mentoring** students throughout my university years. As a **teaching assistant** in courses such as **Network Security & Encryption**, **Data Structures & Algorithms** and **Theory of Languages and Automata**, I designed assignments, evaluated student work, and assisted in making complex topics more accessible to students. My role as a TA has strengthened my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly and effectively.

Moreover, I have conducted research on **Data Compression & AI Applications**, presenting findings and helping students explore the exciting intersection between compression techniques and artificial intelligence. Over the course of five semesters, I also supported students as a TA in **Basic & Advanced Programming**, guiding them through practical programming challenges.
